Similarly, if the agent receives also rewards that\ncreate suboptimal modes of the objective function, it will likely prematurely\nstop exploring. More recent methods add auxiliary intrinsic rewards to\nencourage exploration. However, auxiliary rewards lead to a non-stationary\ntarget for the Q-function. In this paper, we present a novel approach that (1)\nplans exploration actions far into the future by using a long-term visitation\ncount, and (2) decouples exploration and exploitation by learning a separate\nfunction assessing the exploration value of the actions. Contrary to existing\nmethods which use models of reward and dynamics, our approach is off-policy and\nmodel-free. We further propose new tabular environments for benchmarking\nexploration in reinforcement learning. Empirical results on classic and novel\nbenchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in\nenvironments with sparse rewards, especially in the presence of rewards that\ncreate suboptimal modes of the objective function. Results also suggest that\nour approach scales gracefully with the size of the environment.

Here we present the first such clumpy wind simulations\nin 1-D and 2-D, obtained by simulating parsec scale outflows irradiated by an\nAGN. By combining an analysis of our extensive parameter survey with physical\narguments, we show that the lack of clumps in previous numerical models can be\nattributed to the following three effects: (i) insufficient radiative heating\nor other physical processes that prevent the outflowing gas from entering the\nTI zone; (ii) the stabilizing effect of stretching (due to rapid radial\nacceleration) in cases where the gas enters the TI zone; and (iii) a flow speed\neffect: in circumstances where stretching is inefficient, the flow can still be\nso fast that it passes through the TI zone too quickly for perturbations to\ngrow.

However, executing the inference of Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs) is still challenging considering high computation and\nstorage demands, specifically, if real-time performance with high accuracy is\nneeded. Weight pruning of DNNs is proposed, but existing schemes represent two\nextremes in the design space: non-structured pruning is fine-grained, accurate,\nbut not hardware friendly; structured pruning is coarse-grained,\nhardware-efficient, but with higher accuracy loss.

Methanol and acetaldehyde in the\n  protostellar jet-driven shocks L1157-B0 and B1", "abstract": "Aim: In the past, observations of protostellar shocks have been able to set\nconstraints on the formation route of formamide (NH2CHO), exploiting its\nobserved spatial distribution and comparison with astrochemical model\npredictions. In this work, we follow the same strategy to study the case of\nacetaldehyde (CH3CHO). Method: To this end, we used the data obtained with the\nIRAM-NOEMA interferometer in the framework of the Large Program SOLIS to image\nthe B0 and B1 shocks along the L1157 blueshifted outflow in methanol (CH3OH)\nand acetaldehyde line emission. Results: We imaged six CH3OH and eight CH3CHO\nlines which cover upper level energies up to 30 K. Both species trace the B0\nmolecular cavity as well as the northern B1 portion, i.e. the regions where the\nyoungest shocks (1000 yr) occurred. The CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CHO emission peaks\ntowards the B1b clump, where we measured the following column densities and\nrelative abundances: 1.3 x 10^16 cm-2 and 6.5 x 10-6 (methanol), and 7 x 10^13\ncm-2 and 3.5 x 10-8 (acetaldehyde). We carried out a non-LTE LVG analysis of\nthe observed CH3OH line: the average kinetic temperature and density of the\nemitting gas are Tkin = 90 K and nH2 = 4 x 10^5 cm-3, respectively. The CH3OH\nand CH3CHO abundance ratio towards B1b is 190, varying by less than a factor 3\nthroughout the whole B0-B1 structure. Conclusions: The comparison of\nastrochemical model predictions with the observed methanol and acetaldehyde\nspatial distribution does not allow to distinguish whether acetaldehyde is\nformed on the grain mantles or rather on the gas-phase, as its gas-phase\nformation, dominated by the reaction of ethyl radical (CH3CH2) with atomic\noxygen, is very fast.

It is known that two non-isomorphic n-cell coupled networks can\ndetermine the same sets of vector fields -- these networks are said to be\nODE-equivalent. The set of all n-cell coupled networks is so partitioned into\nclasses of ODE-equivalent networks. With no further restrictions, the number of\nODE-classes is not finite and each class has an infinite number of networks.\nInside each ODE-class we can find a finite subclass of networks that minimize\nthe number of edges in the class, called minimal networks.\n  In this paper, we consider coupled cell networks with asymmetric inputs. That\nis, if k is the number of distinct edges types, these networks have the\nproperty that every cell receives k inputs, one of each type. Fixing the number\nn of cells, we prove that: the number of ODE-classes is finite; restricting to\na maximum of n(n-1) inputs, we can cover all the ODE-classes; all minimal\nn-cell networks with n(n-1) asymmetric inputs are ODE-equivalent. We also give\na simple criterion to test if a network is minimal and we conjecture lower\nestimates for the number of distinct ODE-classes of n-cell networks with any\nnumber k of asymmetric inputs. Moreover, we present a full list of\nrepresentatives of the ODE-classes of networks with three cells and two\nasymmetric inputs.", "authors": "Manuela Aguiar, Ana Dias and Pedro Soares", "categories": "math.DS", "doi": "10.1088/1361-6544/ac0b2e", "submitter": "Manuela Aguiar", "year": "2020"}

To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement\nLearning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically\nlearn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs\namong the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem\nsince the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of\nthe others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the\nnetwork.\n  In this paper, we focus on solving this problem in a decentralized way, where\nSTAs independently explore the different APs inside their coverage range, and\nselect the one that better satisfy their needs. To do it, we propose a novel\napproach called Opportunistic epsilon-greedy with Stickiness that halts the\nexploration when a suitable AP is found, only resuming the exploration after\nseveral unsatisfactory association rounds. With this approach, we reduce\nsignificantly the network response dynamics, improving the ability of the STAs\nto find a solution faster, as well as achieving a more efficient use of the\nnetwork resources.\n  We investigate how the characteristics of the scenario (position of the APs\nand STAs, traffic loads, and channel allocation strategies) impact the learning\nprocess and the achievable performance.

Using IFU data from the ongoing\nSDSS-IV MaNGA survey, we have performed a thorough search for WR galaxies. We\nfirst identify H II regions in each datacube and carry out full spectral\nfitting to the stacked spectra. We then visually inspect the residual spectrum\nof each H II region and identify WR regions that present a significant \"blue\nbump\" at 4600-4750 A. The resulting WR catalog includes 267 WR regions of\n~500pc (radius) sizes, distributed in 90 galaxies from the current sample of\nMaNGA (MaNGA Product Launch 7). We find WR regions are exclusively found in\ngalaxies that show bluest colors and highest star formation rates for their\nmass. Most WR galaxies have late-type morphologies and show relatively large\nasymmetry in their images, implying that WR regions are more preferentially\nfound in interacting/merging galaxies. We estimate the stellar mass function of\nWR galaxies and the mass-dependent detection rate. The detection rate of WR\ngalaxies is typically ~2%, with weak dependence on stellar mass. This detection\nrate is about 40 times higher than previous studies with SDSS single fiber\ndata, and by a factor of 2 lower than the CALIFA-based WR catalog.

In this work,\nwe propose a method to jointly infer a task goal and humans' strategic\npreferences via network distillation. This approach enables us to distill a\nrobust task reward (addressing reward ambiguity) and to model each strategy's\nobjective (handling heterogeneity). We demonstrate our algorithm can better\nrecover task reward and strategy rewards and imitate the strategies in two\nsimulated tasks and a real-world table tennis task.", "authors": "Letian Chen, Rohan Paleja, Muyleng Ghuy, Matthew Gombolay", "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO stat.ML", "doi": "10.1145/3319502.3374791", "submitter": "Letian Chen", "year": "2020"}

In this work we test the validity of this prediction by\nstudying a sample of star-forming galaxies at $0.6<z<1.0$ from the LEGA-C\nsurvey, which provides high signal-to-noise measurements of stellar and gas\nkinematics.

However, if the two-atom system is initially prepared in the\nunfactorizable symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, the average rate of\nchange of energy of the two-atom system is never perturbed by the vacuum\nfluctuations, but is totally a result of the atomic radiation reaction.

However, current multi-tasking optimization algorithms have some\ndeficiencies. For high similarity problems, the knowledge that can accelerate\nthe convergence rate of tasks has not been fully taken advantages of. For low\nsimilarity problems, the probability of generating negative transfer is high,\nwhich may result in optimization performance degradation. In addition, some\nknowledge transfer methods proposed previously do not fully consider how to\ndeal with the situation in which the population falls into local optimum. To\nsolve these issues, a two-stage adaptive knowledge transfer evolutionary\nmulti-tasking optimization algorithm based on population distribution, labeled\nas EMT-PD, is proposed. EMT-PD can accelerate and improve the convergence\nperformance of tasks based on the knowledge extracted from the probability\nmodel that reflects the search trend of the whole population. At the first\ntransfer stage, an adaptive weight is used to adjust the step size of\nindividual's search, which can reduce the impact of negative transfer. At the\nsecond stage of knowledge transfer, the individual's search range is further\nadjusted dynamically, which can improve the diversity of population and be\nbeneficial for jumping out of local optimum.

However, the construction of cubature formulas has not generally\nbeen known, and existing examples only represent the particular domains of\nintegrands, such as hypercubes and spheres. In this study, we show that\ncubature formulas can be constructed for probability measures provided that we\nhave an i.i.d. sampler from the measure and the mean values of given test\nfunctions. Moreover, the proposed method also works as a means of data\ncompression, even if sufficient prior information of the measure is not\navailable.", "authors": "Satoshi Hayakawa", "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math.PR", "doi": "10.1007/s13160-020-00451-x", "submitter": "Satoshi Hayakawa", "year": "2020"}

In this paper, we propose a generalization of TOP, namely the Steiner\nTeam Orienteering Problem (STOP). In STOP, we provide, additionally, a subset\nof mandatory locations. In this sense, STOP also aims at maximizing the total\nsum of rewards collected within the time limit, but, now, every mandatory\nlocation must be visited. In this work, we propose a new commodity-based\nformulation for STOP and use it within a cutting-plane scheme. The algorithm\nbenefits from the compactness and strength of the proposed formulation and\nworks by separating three families of valid inequalities, which consist of some\ngeneral connectivity constraints, classical lifted cover inequalities based on\ndual bounds and a class of conflict cuts. To our knowledge, the last class of\ninequalities is also introduced in this work. A state-of-the-art branch-and-cut\nalgorithm from the literature of TOP is adapted to STOP and used as baseline to\nevaluate the performance of the cutting-plane. Extensive computational\nexperiments show the competitiveness of the new algorithm while solving several\nSTOP and TOP instances. In particular, it is able to solve, in total, 14 more\nTOP instances than any other previous exact algorithm and finds eight new\noptimality certificates. With respect to the new STOP instances introduced in\nthis work, our algorithm solves 30 more instances than the baseline.", "authors": "Lucas Assun\\c{c}\\~ao and Geraldo Robson Mateus", "categories": "cs.DS", "doi": "10.1016/j.cie.2019.06.051", "submitter": "Lucas Assun\\c{c}\\~ao", "year": "2020"}

{"id": "2001.00868", "title": "3D Turbulent Reconnection: Theory, Tests and Astrophysical Implications", "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection, topological change in magnetic fields, is a\nfundamental process in magnetized plasmas. It is associated with energy release\nin regions of magnetic field annihilation, but this is only one facet of this\nprocess. Astrophysical flows normally have very large Reynolds numbers and are\nexpected to be turbulent, in agreement with observations. In strong turbulence\nmagnetic lines constantly reconnect everywhere at all scales, making magnetic\nreconnection an intrinsic part of turbulent cascade. We note that this is\ninconsistent with the usual practice of regarding magnetic lines as persistent\ndynamical elements. A number of theoretical, numerical, and observational\nstudies, starting with Lazarian & Vishniac (1999), demonstrated that 3D\nturbulence makes magnetic reconnection fast and that these two processes are\nintrinsically connected. We discuss the dramatic violation of the textbook\nconcept of magnetic flux-freezing in the presence of turbulence and demonstrate\nthat in the presence of turbulence the plasma effects are subdominant to\nturbulence as far as the magnetic reconnection is concerned. This justifies an\nMHD-like treatment of magnetic reconnection at scales much larger than the\nrelevant plasma scales. We discuss numerical and observational evidences\nsupporting the turbulent reconnection model. In particular, we show that\ntearing reconnection is suppressed in 3D and, unlike the 2D case, the 3D\nreconnection induces turbulence that makes reconnection independent of\nresistivity. We show that turbulent reconnection dramatically affects the key\nastrophysical processes, e.g., star formation, turbulent dynamo, acceleration\nof cosmic rays. We provide criticism of the concept of \"reconnection-mediated\nturbulence\" and explain why turbulent reconnection is very different from\nenhanced turbulent resistivity and hyper-resistivity, and why the latter has\nfatal conceptual flaws.", "authors": "Alex Lazarian and Gregory L.

In this paper, we\nseek to characterize those uncertainties given the types of information\navailable today, independent of the specific technique used. We conduct\nsynthetic RM observations through the ICM of a galaxy cluster drawn from an MHD\ncosmological simulation in which the magnetic field is known. We analyze the\nsynthetic RM observations using an analytical formalism based on commonly used\nmodel assumptions allowing us to relate model physical variables to outcome\nuncertainties. Despite the simplicity of some assumptions, and unknown physical\nparameters, we are able to extract an approximate magnitude of the central\nmagnetic field within an apparently irreducible uncertain factor approximately\n3. Principal, largely irreducible, uncertainties come from the unknown depth\nalong the line of sight of embedded polarized sources, the lack of robust\ncoherence lengths from area-constrained polarization sampling, and the unknown\nscaling between ICM electron density and magnetic field strength.

We use\nmolecular beam epitaxy to grow thin films of topological insulator Bi2Te3 on a\ncuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, and study the surface of Bi2Te3 using low-temperature\nscanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. In few unit-cell thick Bi2Te3\nfilms, we find a V-shaped gap-like feature at the Fermi energy in dI/dV\nspectra. By reducing the coverage of Bi2Te3 films to create nanoscale islands,\nwe discover that this spectral feature dramatically evolves into a much larger\nhard gap, which can be understood as a Coulomb blockade gap. This conclusion is\nsupported by the evolution of dI/dV spectra with the lateral size of Bi2Te3\nislands, as well as by topographic measurements that show an additional barrier\nseparating Bi2Te3 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. We conclude that the prominent gap-like\nfeature in dI/dV spectra in Bi2Te3 films is not a proximity-induced\nsuperconducting gap. Instead, it can be explained by Coulomb blockade effects,\nwhich take into account additional resistive and capacitive coupling at the\ninterface.

However, the sources of\nneutrinos are still unknown. In this study, we use radio very-long-baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) data for a complete VLBI-flux-density limited sample of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN). We address the problem of the origin of\nastrophysical neutrinos with energies above 200 TeV in a statistical manner. It\nis found that AGN positionally associated with IceCube events have typically\nstronger parsec-scale cores than the rest of the sample. The post-trial\nprobability of a chance coincidence is 0.2%. We select the four strongest AGN\nas highly probable associations: 3C 279, NRAO 530, PKS 1741-038, and PKS\n2145+067. Moreover, we find an increase of radio emission at frequencies above\n10 GHz around neutrino arrival times for several other VLBI-selected AGN on the\nbasis of RATAN-600 monitoring. The most pronounced example of such behavior is\nPKS 1502+106. We conclude that AGN with bright Doppler-boosted jets constitute\nan important population of neutrino sources. High-energy neutrinos are produced\nin their central parsec-scale regions, probably in proton-photon interactions\nat or around the accretion disk.

Each of the possibly exponentially many Benders' cuts is\nseparated on the fly through the resolution of an instance of the classical 0-1\noptimization problem counterpart. Since these separation subproblems may be\nNP-hard, not all of them can be modeled by means of linear programming, unless\nP = NP. In these cases, the convergence of the aforementioned algorithms are\nnot guaranteed in a straightforward manner.

Here we address\ncloud formation processes by combining HSIA with molecular line data. One\nscenario proposed by numerical simulations is that the column density\nprobability density functions (N-PDF) evolves from a log-normal shape at early\ntimes to a power-law-like shape at later times. In this paper, we study the\ncold atomic component of the giant molecular filament GMF38a (d=3.4 kpc,\nlength$\\sim230$ pc). We identify an extended HISA feature, which is partly\ncorrelated with the 13CO emission. The peak velocities of the HISA and 13CO\nobservations agree well on the eastern side of the filament, whereas a velocity\noffset of approximately 4 km s$^{-1}$ is found on the western side. The sonic\nMach number we derive from the linewidth measurements shows that a large\nfraction of the HISA, which is ascribed to the cold neutral medium (CNM), is at\nsubsonic and transonic velocities. The column density of the CNM is on the\norder of 10$^{20}$ to 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The column density of molecular\nhydrogen is an order of magnitude higher. The N-PDFs from HISA (CNM), HI\nemission (WNM+CNM), and 13CO (molecular component) are well described by\nlog-normal functions, which is in agreement with turbulent motions being the\nmain driver of cloud dynamics. The N-PDF of the molecular component also shows\na power law in the high column-density region, indicating self-gravity. We\nsuggest that we are witnessing two different evolutionary stages within the\nfilament.

Existing pruning methods either\ntrain from scratch with sparsity constraints or minimize the reconstruction\nerror between the feature maps of the pre-trained models and the compressed\nones. Both strategies suffer from some limitations: the former kind is\ncomputationally expensive and difficult to converge, while the latter kind\noptimizes the reconstruction error but ignores the discriminative power of\nchannels. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective method called\ndiscrimination-aware channel pruning (DCP) to choose the channels that actually\ncontribute to the discriminative power. Note that a channel often consists of a\nset of kernels. Besides the redundancy in channels, some kernels in a channel\nmay also be redundant and fail to contribute to the discriminative power of the\nnetwork, resulting in kernel level redundancy. To solve this, we propose a\ndiscrimination-aware kernel pruning (DKP) method to further compress deep\nnetworks by removing redundant kernels. To prevent DCP/DKP from selecting\nredundant channels/kernels, we propose a new adaptive stopping condition, which\nhelps to automatically determine the number of selected channels/kernels and\noften results in more compact models with better performance.

Since tidal dissipation makes possible the exit from the current\nresonances or capture into new ones, we investigate the capture of Callisto\ninto resonance.\n  Methods. We perform hundreds of propagations using an improved version of a\nrecent semi-analytical model. As Ganymede moves outwards, it approaches the 2:1\nresonance with Callisto, inducing a temporary chaotic motion in the system. For\nthis reason, we draw a statistical picture of the outcome of the resonant\nencounter.\n  Results. The system can settle into two distinct outcomes: A) a chain of\nthree 2:1 two-body resonances (Io-Europa, Europa-Ganymede and\nGanymede-Callisto), or B) a resonant chain involving the 2:1 two-body resonance\nIo-Europa plus at least one pure 4:2:1 three-body resonance, most frequently\nbetween Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

For solving the radiation diffusion equations, many linear systems\nare obtained in the nonlinear iterations at each time step. The cost of linear\nequations dominates the numerical simulation of radiation diffusion\napplications, such as inertial confinement fusion, etc. {Usually,} iterative\nmethods are used to solve the linear systems in {a} real application.\n{Moreover, the solution of the previous nonlinear iteration or the solution of\nthe previous time step is typically used as the initial guess for solving the\ncurrent linear equations.} Because of the strong local character in ICF, with\nthe advancing of nonlinear iteration and time step, the solution of the linear\nsystem changes dramatically in some local domain, and changes mildly or even\nhas no change in the rest domain. In this paper, a local {character-based}\nmethod is proposed to solve the linear systems of radiation diffusion problems.\nThe proposed method consists of three steps: firstly, a local domain (algebraic\ndomain) is constructed; secondly, the subsystem on the local domain is solved;\nand lastly, the whole system will be solved. Two methods are given to construct\nthe local domain. One is based on the spatial gradient, and the other is based\non the residual. Numerical tests for a two-dimensional heat conduction model\nproblem, and two real application models, the multi-group radiation diffusion\nequations and the three temperature energy equations, are conducted.

First, the\nempirical observations along the collective variable are defined by an ensemble\nof discrete observations and the coarsening of these observations into a\nhistogram bins incurs unnecessary loss of information. Second, the free energy\nsurface is itself almost always a continuous function, and its representation\nby a histogram introduces inherent approximations due to the discretization.

In the\ncontext of correlation-based processing, such arrays enable to resolve more\nuncorrelated sources than physical sensors. This property of sparse arrays\nstems from the size of their difference coarrays, defined as the differences of\nelement locations. Thus, the design of sparse arrays with large difference\ncoarrays is of great interest. In addition, other array properties such as\nsymmetry, robustness and array economy are important in different applications.\nNumerous studies have proposed diverse sparse geometries, focusing on certain\nproperties while lacking others. Incorporating multiple properties into the\ndesign task leads to combinatorial problems which are generally NP-hard. For\nsmall arrays these optimization problems can be solved by brute force, however,\nin large scale they become intractable.

Our main result\nstates that for an appropriate choice of the generator such fractal arrays\nexhibit large difference coarrays. Furthermore, we show that the fractal arrays\ninherit their properties from their generators.

Here, we analyze the role of\nplating-induced stress in dendrite formation through first-principles\ncalculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the\ndeposited Li forms a stable atomic nanofilm structure on copper (Cu) substrate.\nIt is found that the adsorption energy of Li atoms increases from the Li-Cu\ninterface to deposited Li surface, leading to more aggregated Li atoms at the\ninterface. Compared to the pristine Li metal, the deposited Li in the early\nstage becomes compacted and suffers in-plane compressive stress. Interestingly,\nwe find that there is a giant strain gradient distribution from the Li-Cu\ninterface to deposited Li surface, which makes the deposited atoms adjacent to\nthe Cu surface tend to press upwards with perturbation, causing the dendrite\ngrowth. This understanding provides an insight to the atomic-scale origin of Li\ndendrite growth and may be useful for suppressing the Li dendrite in the\nLi-metal-based rechargeable batteries.", "authors": "Gao Xu, Feng Hao, Jiawang Hong and Daining Fang", "categories": "cond-mat.mtrl-sci", "doi": "10.1007/s10483-020-2596-5", "submitter": "Jiawang Hong", "year": "2020"}

Second, a kink going through a Y-junction transforms into three\ndaughter kinks. In this way, the existence of Y-junctions also increases the\nnumber of kinks on cosmic superstrings.

One pixel in the image\ncorresponds to a one millimeter piece of tissue. In order to accurately segment\ntumors and make treatment plans, doctors need CT scans of higher resolution.\nThe same problem appears in MRI. In this paper, we propose an approach for the\nsingle-image super-resolution of 3D CT or MRI scans. Our method is based on\ndeep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) composed of 10 convolutional layers\nand an intermediate upscaling layer that is placed after the first 6\nconvolutional layers. Our first CNN, which increases the resolution on two axes\n(width and height), is followed by a second CNN, which increases the resolution\non the third axis (depth). Different from other methods, we compute the loss\nwith respect to the ground-truth high-resolution output right after the\nupscaling layer, in addition to computing the loss after the last convolutional\nlayer. The intermediate loss forces our network to produce a better output,\ncloser to the ground-truth. A widely-used approach to obtain sharp results is\nto add Gaussian blur using a fixed standard deviation. In order to avoid\noverfitting to a fixed standard deviation, we apply Gaussian smoothing with\nvarious standard deviations, unlike other approaches.

This study seeks to evaluate if pedestrians clearly\nunderstand the driving intentions of AVs in interactions and presents\nexperimental research on the relationship between gaze behaviors of pedestrians\nand their understanding of the intentions of the AV. The hypothesis\ninvestigated in this study was that the less the pedestrian understands the\ndriving intentions of the AV, the longer the duration of their gazing behavior\nwill be. A pedestrian--vehicle interaction experiment was designed to verify\nthe proposed hypothesis. A robotic wheelchair was used as the manual driving\nvehicle (MV) and AV for interacting with pedestrians while pedestrians' gaze\ndata and their subjective evaluation of the driving intentions were recorded.\nThe experimental results supported our hypothesis as there was a negative\ncorrelation between the pedestrians' gaze duration on the AV and their\nunderstanding of the driving intentions of the AV. Moreover, the gaze duration\nof most of the pedestrians on the MV was shorter than that on an AV. Therefore,\nwe conclude with two recommendations to designers of external human-machine\ninterfaces (eHMI): (1) when a pedestrian is engaged in an interaction with an\nAV, the driving intentions of the AV should be provided; (2) if the pedestrian\nstill gazes at the AV after the AV displays its driving intentions, the AV\nshould provide clearer information about its driving intentions.", "authors": "Hailong Liu, Takatsugu Hirayama, Luis Yoichi Morales, Hiroshi Murase", "categories": "cs.HC", "doi": "10.1080/10447318.2022.2073006", "submitter": "HaiLong Liu", "year": "2020"}

It is experimentally\nand numerically proved that the temperature change dT commences almost\nsynchronously with the released power peak and T-coupling reveals itself up to\na frequency of about 10 kHz. For the studied switching structure configuration,\nthe RTC value varies over a wide range from 4 to 45 mkm, depending on the\nexternal circuit capacitance C and resistance Ri, but the variation of Ri is\nmore promising from the practical viewpoint. In the case of a \"weak\" coupling,\nsynchronization is accompanied by attraction effect and decrease of the main\nspectra harmonics width.

IR\nspectroscopy is a common method used for measurement of the photodesorption\nyield in ices. We found that undetectable C atoms produced in irradiated CO$_2$\nice can account for 33% of the amount of depleted CO$_2$ molecules in the ice.\nA quantitative calibration of QMS was therefore performed to convert the\nmeasured ion current into photodesorption yield. During various irradiation\nperiods, the dominant photodesorbing species were CO, O$_2$, and CO$_2$, and\ntheir photodesorption yields in CO$_2$ ices deposited at different temperature\nconfigurations were almost the same, indicating that ice morphology has no\neffect on the photodesorption yield of CO$_2$ ice. In addition, we found that\nthe lower desorption yield reported by Mart\\'in-Dom\\'enech et al. is due to a\nlinear relationship between the photodesorption yield and the combination of\nenergy distribution of Microwave-Discharge Hydrogen-flow Lamp (MDHL) and UV\nabsorption cross section of ices.", "authors": "N.-E.

In\norder to disclose the joint effects of surface structure and mixed wettability\non nucleate boiling, in this work we propose an improved type of\npillar-textured surface with mixed wettability, in which the tops of square\npillars are partially subjected to wettability modification. Numerical\ninvestigation of the boiling heat transfer performance on the improved\nmixed-wettability surface is carried out using a three-dimensional thermal\nmultiphase lattice Boltzmann model. The numerical results show that the width\nof the wettability-modified region plays an important role in the boiling\nperformance of the improved mixed-wettability surface and the best boiling\nperformance is achieved in the situation that the width of the\nwettability-modified region is sufficiently large but the bubble nucleated on\nthe pillar top still does not interfere with the coalescence-departure\nmechanism of the bubbles nucleated around the pillar, which optimizes the joint\neffects of surface structure and mixed wettability for enhancing nucleate\nboiling.

So far, most of existing FTJs have been based on perovskite-oxide\nbarrier layers. The recent discovery of the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals\nferroelectric materials opens a new route to realize tunnel junctions with new\nfunctionalities and nm-scale dimensions. Due to the weak coupling between the\natomic layers in these materials, the relative dipole alignment between them\ncan be controlled by applied voltage. This allows transitions between\nferroelectric and antiferroelectric orderings, resulting in significant changes\nof the electronic structure. Here, we propose to realize 2D antiferroelectric\ntunnel junctions (AFTJs), which exploit this new functionality, based on\nbilayer In$_2$X$_3$ (X = S, Se, Te) barriers and different 2D electrodes. Using\nfirst-principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that\nthe In$_2$X$_3$ bilayers exhibit stable ferroelectric and antiferroelectric\nstates separated by sizable energy barriers, thus supporting a non-volatile\nswitching between these states. Using quantum-mechanical modeling of the\nelectronic transport, we explore in-plane and out-of-plane tunneling across the\nIn$_2$S$_3$ van der Waals bilayers, and predict giant tunneling\nelectroresistance (TER) effects and multiple non-volatile resistance states\ndriven by ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order transitions.

The data\nfrom M87 collected between 2012 and 2015 as part of a MAGIC monitoring\nprogramme are analysed and combined with multi-wavelength data from Fermi-LAT,\nChandra, HST, EVN, VLBA and the Liverpool Telescope.

Methods: We start with estimating and visualizing\nlinks within and among extracted multimodal data features using a Gaussian\ngraphical model (GGM).

We make a comparative\nstudy of the high- and low-scale seesaw scenarios and the effect of the Dirac\nneutrino Yukawa couplings on the stability of the Higgs potential. Bounds on\nthe scalar quartic couplings and Dirac Yukawa couplings are obtained from\nvacuum stability and perturbativity considerations.

These theoretical constraints give a very predictive parameter\nspace for the couplings and masses of the new scalars and RHNs which can be\ntested at the LHC and future colliders.

Monolayer\nsemiconducting transitional metal dichalcogenides have emerged as an\noutstanding platform for studying these coupling effects because they possess\nunique spin-valley locking physics for hosting rich excitonic species and the\nreduced screening for strong Coulomb interactions. Here, we report the\nobservation of multiple valley phonons, phonons with momentum vectors pointing\nto the corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, and the resulting exciton\ncomplexes in the monolayer semiconductor WSe2. From Lande g-factor and\npolarization analyses of photoluminescence peaks, we find that these valley\nphonons lead to efficient intervalley scattering of quasi particles in both\nexciton formation and relaxation. This leads to a series of photoluminescence\npeaks as valley phonon replicas of dark trions. Using identified valley\nphonons, we also uncovered an intervalley exciton near charge neutrality, and\nextract its short-range electron-hole exchange interaction to be about 10 meV.\nOur work not only identifies a number of previously unknown 2D excitonic\nspecies, but also shows that monolayer WSe2 is a prime candidate for studying\ninteractions between spin, pseudospin, and zone-edge phonons.", "authors": "Minhao He, Pasqual Rivera, Dinh Van Tuan, Nathan P.

{"id": "2001.01797", "title": "Bridge Modal Identification using Acceleration Measurements within\n  Moving Vehicles", "abstract": "Vehicles crossing bridge structures respond dynamically to the bridge's\nvibrations. An acceleration signal collected within a moving vehicle contains a\ntrace of the bridge's structural response, but also includes other sources such\nas the vehicle suspension system and surface roughness-induced vibrations. This\npaper introduces two methods for the bridge system identification using data\ncollected by a network of moving vehicles. The contributions of the vehicle\nsuspension system are removed by deconvolving the vehicle response in frequency\ndomain. The first approach utilizes the vehicle transfer function, and the\nsecond uses EEMD method. Next, roughness-induced vibrations are extracted using\nsecond-order blind identification (SOBI) method. After these two processes the\nresulting signal is equivalent to the readings of mobile sensors that scan the\nbridge's dynamic response. Structural modal identification using mobile sensor\ndata has been recently introduced as STRIDEX algorithm. The processed mobile\nsensor data is analyzed using STRIDEX to identify the modal properties of the\nbridge. The performance of the methods is validated on numerical case studies\nof a long single-span bridge monitored via a network of moving vehicles. The\nanalyses consider three road surface roughness patterns. Results show that the\nproposed algorithms are successful in extracting pure bridge vibrations, and\nproduce accurate and comprehensive modal properties of the bridge. The study\nshows that the proposed transfer function method can efficiently deconvolve the\nlinear dynamics of a moving vehicle. EEMD method is able to extract vehicle\ndynamic response without a-priori information about the vehicle. This study is\nthe first proposed methodology for complete bridge modal identification,\nincluding operational natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios using\n\\textit{moving vehicles sensor data}.", "authors": "Soheil Sadeghi Eshkevari, Thomas J.

Existing listwise learning-to-rank models\nare generally derived from the classical Plackett-Luce model, which has three\nmajor limitations. (1) Its permutation probabilities overlook ties, i.e., a\nsituation when more than one document has the same rating with respect to a\nquery. This can lead to imprecise permutation probabilities and inefficient\ntraining because of selecting documents one by one. (2) It does not favor\ndocuments having high relevance. (3) It has a loose assumption that sampling\ndocuments at different steps is independent. To overcome the first two\nlimitations, we model ranking as selecting documents from a candidate set based\non unique rating levels in decreasing order. The number of steps in training is\ndetermined by the number of unique rating levels. We propose a new loss\nfunction and associated four models for the entire sequence of weighted\nclassification tasks by assigning high weights to the selected documents with\nhigh ratings for optimizing Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).

Accordingly, cloud data centres become major NFV vendors\nfor enterprise traffic processing. Due to the privacy concern of traffic\nredirection to the cloud, secure middlebox systems (e.g., BlindBox) draw much\nattention; they can process encrypted packets against encrypted rules directly.\nHowever, most of the existing systems supporting pattern matching based network\nfunctions require the enterprise gateway to tokenise packet payloads via\nsliding windows. Such tokenisation induces a considerable communication\noverhead, which can be over 100$\\times$ to the packet size. To overcome this\nbottleneck, in this paper, we propose the first bandwidth-efficient encrypted\npattern matching protocol for secure middleboxes. We resort to a primitive\ncalled symmetric hidden vector encryption (SHVE), and propose a variant of it,\naka SHVE+, to achieve constant and moderate communication cost. To speed up, we\ndevise encrypted filters to reduce the number of accesses to SHVE+ during\nmatching highly. We formalise the security of our proposed protocol and conduct\ncomprehensive evaluations over real-world rulesets and traffic dumps.

The computational intractability of interpretable learning\nled practitioners to design heuristic techniques, which fail to provide sound\nhandles to tradeoff accuracy and interpretability.\n  Motivated by the success of MaxSAT solvers over the past decade, recently\nMaxSAT-based approach, called MLIC, was proposed that seeks to reduce the\nproblem of learning interpretable rules expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form\n(CNF) to a MaxSAT query. While MLIC was shown to achieve accuracy similar to\nthat of other state of the art black-box classifiers while generating small\ninterpretable CNF formulas, the runtime performance of MLIC is significantly\nlagging and renders approach unusable in practice. In this context, authors\nraised the question: Is it possible to achieve the best of both worlds, i.e., a\nsound framework for interpretable learning that can take advantage of MaxSAT\nsolvers while scaling to real-world instances?\n  In this paper, we take a step towards answering the above question in\naffirmation. We propose IMLI: an incremental approach to MaxSAT based framework\nthat achieves scalable runtime performance via partition-based training\nmethodology.

We find, both theoretically and experimentally, that the\nshort-wavelength buckled configuration is energetically favorable for growing\nmembranes lying on liquid, while the global buckling shape is more preferable\nfor suspended ones. Other influencing factors such as stem/vein, heterogeneity\nand dimension are also investigated.

The grid is subject\nto incremental time-harmonic dynamic motion, superimposed to a given state of\naxial loading of arbitrary magnitude. In contrast to the quasi-static energy\nmatch (addressed in Part I of the present study), the vibrational properties of\nthe lattice are directly represented by the acoustic tensor of the equivalent\nsolid (without passing through the constitutive tensor). The acoustic tensor is\nshown to be independent of the rods' rotational inertia and allows the analysis\nof strong ellipticity of the equivalent continuum, evidencing coincidence with\nmacro-bifurcation in the lattice. On the other hand, micro-bifurcation\ncorresponds to a vibration of vanishing frequency of the lowest dispersion\nbranch of the lattice, occurring at finite wavelength. Dynamic homogenization\nreveals the structure of the acoustic branches close to ellipticity loss and\nthe analysis of forced vibrations (both in physical space and Fourier space)\nshows low-frequency wave localizations. A comparison is presented between\nstrain localization occurring near ellipticity loss and forced vibration of the\nlattice, both corresponding to the application of a concentrated pulsating\nforce. The comparison shows that the homogenization technique allows an almost\nperfect representation of the lattice, with the exception of cases where\nmicro-bifurcation occurs, which is shown to leave the equivalent solid\nunaffected.

The local\ncharacteristics associated with ridership change are evaluated in Portland,\nMiami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta. Poisson models explain ridership as a\ncross-section and the change thereof as a panel. While controlling for the\nchange in frequency, jobs, and population, the correlation with local\nsocio-demographic characteristics are investigated using data from the American\nCommunity Survey. The effect of changing neighborhood demographics on bus\nridership are modeled using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data. At a\npoint in time, neighborhoods with high proportions of non-white, carless, and\nmost significantly, high-school-educated residents are the most likely to have\nhigh ridership. Over time, white neighborhoods are losing the most ridership\nacross all four cities. In Miami and Atlanta, places with high concentrations\nof residents with college education and without access to a car also lose\nridership at a faster rate. In Minneapolis/St-Paul, the proportion of\ncollege-educated residents is linked to ridership gain. The sign and\nsignificance of these results remain consistent even when controlling for\nintra-urban migration. Although bus ridership is declining across neighborhood\ncharacteristics, these results suggest that the underlying cause of bus\nridership decline must be primarily affecting the travel behavior of white bus\nriders.", "authors": "Simon J.

The typical hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase\nhas been extensively studied, but relatively little attention has been paid to\nthe face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, which has been shown to nucleate in\nconfined structures and may be present in tight-pitch interconnects. Using\n\\emph{ab initio} techniques, we benchmark the performance of fcc Ru.

In addition to studying\nbulk transport properties, we evaluate the performance of adhesion liners for\nfcc Ru. We find that it is energetically more favorable for fcc Ru to bind\ndirectly to silicon dioxide than through conventional adhesion liners such as\nTaN and TiN. In the case that a thin liner is necessary for the Ru deposition\ntechnique, we find that the vertical resistance penalty of a liner for fcc Ru\ncan be up to eight times lower than that calculated for conventional liners\nused for Cu interconnects.

This shows a\ncapability to selectively amplify quantum fluctuations with a predetermined\nmomentum, where the momentum value can be spectroscopically tuned.

This outcome results from advances in physics that\nallow storage of more than one bit per cell, coupled with advances in signal\nprocessing that reduce the effect of physical instabilities. Constrained codes\nare used in storage to avoid problematic patterns. Recently, we introduced\nbinary symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained codes (LOCO codes) for\ndata storage and data transmission. This paper introduces simple constrained\ncodes that support non-binary physical substrates; multi, triple, quad, and the\ncurrently-in-development penta-level cell (M/T/Q/P-LC) Flash memories. The new\ncodes can be easily modified if problematic patterns change with time. These\ncodes are designed to mitigate inter-cell interference, which is a critical\nsource of error in Flash devices. The occurrence of errors is a consequence of\nparasitic capacitances in and across floating gate transistors, resulting in\ncharge propagation from cells being programmed to the highest charge level to\nneighboring cells being programmed to lower levels. The new codes are called\n$q$-ary asymmetric LOCO codes (QA-LOCO codes), and the construction subsumes\ncodes previously designed for single-level cell (SLC) Flash devices (A-LOCO\ncodes). QA-LOCO codes work for a Flash device with any number, $q$, of levels\nper cell.

The two simulations\ndiffer only in whether the initial angular momentum of the plasma is aligned\nwith the rapid (a = 0.9) spin of the black hole. Both have low net magnetic\nflux. Ray tracing is employed to generate resolved images of the synchrotron\nemission. When using parameters appropriate for Sgr A* and assuming a viewing\nangle aligned with the black hole spin, we find the most prominent difference\nis that the central shadow in the image is noticeably eccentric in tilted\nmodels, with the ring of emission relatively unchanged. Applying this procedure\nto M87 with a viewing angle based on the large-scale jet, we find that adding\ntilt increases the angular size of the ring for fixed black hole mass and\ndistance, while at the same time increasing the number of bright spots in the\nimage. Our findings illustrate observable features that can distinguish tilted\nfrom aligned flows.

To render\ngeometrical features, unstructured meshes must be used and this unavoidably\nincreases the degrees of freedom and therefore makes the construction of\nslave/master pairs more demanding. In this work, we introduce an implicit\nmaterial point method designed to bypass the meshing of bodies by employing\nlevel set functions to represent boundaries at structured grids. This implicit\nfunction representation provides an elegant mean to link an unbiased\nintermediate reference surface with the true boundaries by closest point\nprojection as shown in leichner et al.

We then enforce the contact\nconstraints by a penalty method where the Coulomb friction law is implemented\nas an elastoplastic constitutive model such that a return mapping algorithm can\nbe used to provide constitutive updates for both the stick and slip states. To\nevolve the geometry of the contacts properly, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is\nsolved incrementally such that the level set and material points are both\nupdated accord to the deformation field. To improve the accuracy and regularity\nof the numerical integration of the material point method, a moving least\nsquare method is used to project numerical values of the material points back\nto the standard locations for Gaussian-Legendre quadrature.

Using TCSPC, e.g., for the purpose of\nfluorescence lifetime measurements, is often limited in speed due to dead-time\nlosses and pile-up. We show that this limitation can be lifted by reducing the\ndead-time of the timing electronics to the absolute minimum imposed by the\nspeed of the detector signals while maintaining high temporal resolution. A\ncomplementing approach to speedy data acquisition is parallelization by means\nof simultaneous readout of many detector channels. This puts high demands on\nthe data throughput of the TCSPC system, especially in time tagging of\nindividual photon arrivals.

Remaining in the framework based on sparsity and convex\noptimization, we propose improvements to audio inpainting, aiming at\ncompensating for such an energy loss. The new ideas are based on different\ntypes of weighting, both in the coefficient and the time domains. We show that\nour propositions improve the inpainting performance in terms of both the SNR\nand ODG.", "authors": "Ond\\v{r}ej Mokr\\'y and Pavel Rajmic", "categories": "eess.AS cs.SD", "doi": "10.1109/TASLP.2020.3030486", "submitter": "Ond\\v{r}ej Mokr\\'y", "year": "2020"}
